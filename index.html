<p><em>Application Developer</em></p>

<p>I worked on a product called Legal Server. It is a case management system for non
profit legal organizations. They brought me in, setup the Mac, gave me SVN access
and I was hacking from day one. My best project was a case auditing system that
determines when certain legal cases needed attention. The system included fully
integrated options panel for the admin interface. Using Trac, I fielded every kind of
ticket imaginable. Display problems, code problems, interface issues, bugs and
unknowns were common. The code base was eight years old and massive. Even so, I
still found my way around and made meaningful improvements to the company.
Through the help of my team they turned me into a very confident programmer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="academic-experience" class="anchor" href="#academic-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic Experience</h3>

<p><em>CSCI-567 Software Engineering</em></p>

<p>Learned principles and methodology of how to understand client requirements.
Learned how to translate client requirements into viable use cases. I learned how to
estimate software costs using real world planning and response strategies. Exposed
to COCOMO software estimation technique.</p>

<p><em>CSIS-687 Databases and Information Systems</em></p>

<p>Learned about MySQL programming. Exposed to database design fundamentals,
relational algebra, query tuning and core concepts. Fully learned the relational
database model, the data control language, data manipulation language and data
definition language. I use these concepts to build on my understanding for how
MySQL operates. I used C++ and PHP to query databases and build basic applications for the web. I took my comprehensive exam in this subject and it is my
strongest.</p>

<p><em>CSIS-2230 Object Oriented Programming</em></p>

<p>Learned the basics of OOP, the Python language and its standard library. I found a
love for Python in my first year of college. Classes, objects and functions come easy
in python. Ease of access in overriding fundamental behaviors between objects is the
basis for why I use Python to build complex objects. The great built in data types and
structures, access to wonderful 3rd party API's already written and a suburb support
community on IRC make Python one of the most attractive languages to write in.
